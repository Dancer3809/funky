localalias
==========
I use this script to setup aliases and/or functions that are local to a particular directory. Local aliases are stored in a hidden file named `.lshrc` in the current directory. One way to use this script is manually. For example, you could run `LocalAlias -a` to add an alias and then `LocalAlias -x` to execute that alias, like so:
